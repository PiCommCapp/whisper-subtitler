# Algorithm Decision Record: Speaker Identification Improvements

## Problem Statement
The current speaker identification approach in the Whisper-Subtitler has significant limitations that impact transcript accuracy. The algorithm needs to be improved to provide more accurate, consistent speaker identification across diverse government meeting recordings.

Current limitations include:
1. Speaker assignment based only on temporal overlap with a single point (segment start)
2. No utilization of voice characteristics for identification
3. Inconsistent speaker labeling (same speaker may get different IDs)
4. No support for known speaker count
5. No mechanism to associate real names with speakers

## Requirements Analysis
- Must improve speaker identification accuracy
- Must maintain compatibility with Pyannote.audio
- Must support configurable parameters via CLI
- Must integrate with the modular architecture
- Must preserve CUDA acceleration support

## Algorithm Options Analysis

### Option 1: Enhanced Time-Based Association
- **Description**: Improve the current temporal overlap approach by considering maximum overlap duration rather than just start point
- **Pros**:
  - Simple implementation
  - Low computational overhead
  - Easy to understand
  - No additional dependencies
- **Cons**:
  - Limited improvement potential
  - Still ignores voice characteristics
  - No speaker consistency mechanisms
  - No true identity association
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Implementation Time**: 1-2 days
- **Expected Accuracy Improvement**: 10-15%

```python
def assign_speaker_enhanced(whisper_segment, speaker_segments):
    # First try exact match at start point
    for seg in speaker_segments:
        if seg["start"] <= whisper_segment["start"] < seg["end"]:
            return seg["speaker"]
    
    # If no match, find segment with maximum overlap
    max_overlap = 0
    best_speaker = "Unknown"
    segment_start = whisper_segment["start"]
    segment_end = whisper_segment["end"]
    
    for seg in speaker_segments:
        overlap_start = max(seg["start"], segment_start)
        overlap_end = min(seg["end"], segment_end)
        overlap = max(0, overlap_end - overlap_start)
        
        if overlap > max_overlap:
            max_overlap = overlap
            best_speaker = seg["speaker"]
    
    return best_speaker
```

### Option 2: Speaker Clustering with Voice Embeddings
- **Description**: Use voice embeddings from Pyannote to cluster similar speakers and maintain consistent IDs
- **Pros**:
  - Significantly improved speaker consistency
  - Uses voice characteristics
  - Can handle speaker identity across segments
  - Compatible with existing pipeline
- **Cons**:
  - More complex implementation
  - Higher computational requirements
  - Requires additional Pyannote API usage
  - May need threshold tuning
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Implementation Time**: 3-5 days
- **Expected Accuracy Improvement**: 25-40%

```python
def merge_similar_speakers(diarization_result, similarity_threshold=0.85):
    embeddings = {}  # Speaker ID to voice embedding
    
    # Extract voice embeddings for each speaker segment
    for turn, embedding, speaker in diarization_result.itertracks(yield_embedding=True, yield_label=True):
        if speaker not in embeddings:
            embeddings[speaker] = []
        embeddings[speaker].append(embedding)
    
    # Average embeddings per speaker
    for speaker in embeddings:
        embeddings[speaker] = np.mean(embeddings[speaker], axis=0)
    
    # Compute similarity matrix
    speakers = list(embeddings.keys())
    n_speakers = len(speakers)
    similarity_matrix = np.zeros((n_speakers, n_speakers))
    
    for i in range(n_speakers):
        for j in range(i+1, n_speakers):
            similarity = cosine_similarity(
                embeddings[speakers[i]].reshape(1, -1),
                embeddings[speakers[j]].reshape(1, -1)
            )[0][0]
            similarity_matrix[i, j] = similarity
            similarity_matrix[j, i] = similarity
    
    # Cluster speakers
    clusters = {}
    for i, speaker in enumerate(speakers):
        assigned = False
        for cluster_id, cluster_members in clusters.items():
            similarities = [similarity_matrix[i, speakers.index(member)] 
                           for member in cluster_members]
            if all(sim > similarity_threshold for sim in similarities):
                clusters[cluster_id].append(speaker)
                assigned = True
                break
        
        if not assigned:
            # Create new cluster
            clusters[speaker] = [speaker]
    
    # Create mapping of original speakers to final speakers
    speaker_mapping = {}
    for cluster_id, members in clusters.items():
        for member in members:
            speaker_mapping[member] = cluster_id
    
    return speaker_mapping
```

### Option 3: Comprehensive Speaker Identification Pipeline

- **Pros**:

  - Most robust for diverse audio conditions
- **Cons**:
  - Most complex implementation
  - Highest computational cost
  - Multiple components that need integration
  - Requires more extensive testing
- **Complexity**: High
- **Implementation Time**: 7-10 days
- **Expected Accuracy Improvement**: 40-60%
