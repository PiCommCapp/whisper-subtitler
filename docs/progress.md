# Implementation Progress

## Current Status
- Initial project setup is complete with pyproject.toml, README, and basic package structure
- Basic code is functional in the whisper-subtitler package
- CI/CD infrastructure is in place
- Planning for comprehensive refactoring is complete
- Creative design phase has been completed with architecture and algorithm decisions

## Implementation Phases
- [✓] Project repository setup
- [✓] Basic package structure
- [✓] Analysis and planning for modular architecture
- [✓] Creative design for architecture and algorithms
- [ ] Implementation of modular architecture 
- [ ] Enhanced logging implementation
- [ ] Comprehensive CLI interface development
- [ ] Documentation creation
- [ ] Testing framework implementation
- [ ] Accuracy improvement implementation

## Recent Changes
- Repository initialized with proper structure
- Project brief documented
- Memory Bank established for tracking
- Architectural design created for modular structure
- Algorithm design for speaker identification improvements
- Detailed implementation plan developed
- Creative phase completed with key design decisions made

## Creative Phase Decisions
- **Architecture**: Component-based architecture selected for best modularity, testability, and maintainability
- **Algorithm**: Comprehensive speaker identification pipeline with audio preprocessing, speaker clustering, and optimization for known speaker count
- **Implementation Strategy**: Phased approach with core components first, followed by advanced features and testing

## Planning Documents
- **tasks.md**: Detailed task breakdown and tracking
- **implementation-plan.md**: Comprehensive implementation strategy
- **architecture-design-enhanced.md**: Component-based architecture design
- **algorithm-design-enhanced.md**: Speaker identification algorithm improvements

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of the modular architecture
2. Develop the configuration management system
3. Extract core functionality into modules
4. Implement basic CLI interface
5. Add enhanced logging system
